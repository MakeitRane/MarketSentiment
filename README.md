# MarketSentiment

Creating a tool to help crypto investors gain a good sense of the market sentiment. Following big pages may skew the investor's perception of the market. 

Planning on building a tool to read through the past 24 hours of tweets reagarding one coin and summarize the overall market sentiment of that coin on a scale of 1-10.

Users can search up a coin name and get details about the sentiment (on a 1-10 scale) of that coin. Also comes with other basic metrics (# of tweets that were looked through, etc)
